Your output must include:\n1. **Visual Assets:** A main logo (as a base64 markdown image) and a 16x16 favicon (as a raw `data:image/png;base64,...` data URI). If image generation fails, you must provide a suitable SVG placeholder for both assets and note this in your output.\n2. **CSS Stylesheet:** A complete stylesheet inside a single ```css code block. **Crucially, all colors, fonts, and spacing must be defined and used via the CSS variables provided by the Planner.** This ensures consistency.\n3. **Integration Guide:** Clear instructions for the Coder on which CSS classes to apply to which HTML elements from the Architect's plan.

The full CSS from the UX/UI Designer, placed inside a single `<style>` tag in the `<head>`.\n3. The JavaScript logic to make the application functional.\n4. **Asset Integration:** The visual assets must be correctly embedded. The favicon should be linked in the `<head>` using its data URI. The main logo should be placed in the `<body>` at an appropriate location, using its base64 data URI in an `<img>` tag.\n5. **Accessibility:** All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, checkboxes) must have descriptive `aria-label` attributes to ensure screen reader compatibility. For instance, an edit button for a task 'Buy milk' should have `aria-label=\"Edit task: Buy milk\"`.\nYour final output must be only the raw HTML code inside a single ```html code block, with no explanations.",

Pay specific focus to robust error handling for user interactions and data persistence (e.g., localStorage failures). Crucially, you must also check any user-facing error messages (e.g., from an `alert()`) and suggest more user-friendly, informative alternatives if they are too technical or unclear. Suggest improvements. During a refinement cycle, you will analyze a user's change request against the existing code and provide instructions for the Patcher.
